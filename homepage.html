	<p> I am a rising Junior at Pomona College, majoring in Computer Science. I identify as first-generation and Latinx. This summer, I will be working with Professor John Heidemann and graduate student Calvin Ardi at the Information Sciences Institute in the University of Southern California. Some of the things I have been involved with on Pomona College's campus so far include:</p>
	<br>
		<ul style="list-style: none;">
			<li><strong>QuestBridge:</strong> <a href="http://www.questfriends.com/">Pomona College's QuestBridge Chapter</a> is a group on campus is a space for students who identify as first-generation and/or low-income. I've been involved in Pomona's QuestBridge Chapter this past year as the Social Media Associate and as a member of the On-Campus Communications committee for our Annual Money Matters Week event.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Residence Hall Staff:</strong> I was a Sponsor for the 2016-2017 school year. The Sponsor program for Pomona College requires all first year students to be placed in residence halls with two or three sophomores who will act as their mentors or "Sponsors" for their first year. Sponsor pairings, sponsor groups, and sponsor training are responsibilities that Head Sponsors and the RHS Staff oversee.</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Computer Science Department:</strong> I've been involved in the Computer Science Department so far as a mentor for introductory Computer Science courses as well as a participant in a learning community created for and by underrepresented students in computer science. Next semester, I will be one of the group leaders for Pomona's igniteCS program with Colony High School.</li>
